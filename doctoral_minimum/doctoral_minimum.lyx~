\begin_layout Standard
The generalized aim of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a decision making
 process given the contextual understanding.
 Over the last decade, the field made significant progress thanks to both
 spotlight attention of the commercial sector and many scientists and also
 to the immense investment and improvements in computational power.
 The current list of NLP tasks includes but is not limited to such problems
 like: topic classification

 The increased research activity resulted in a brain gain and a strong push
 of the boundaries in a majority of NLP problems, i.e representing language

 The newer and more complex models' architecture approaches, accompanied
 by the motto

 The non arguable outcome of these improvements is an increase in the number

Our research contribution lies in optimal models learning both from scratch
 or fine tuning of the pre-trained parameters.
 The training data collection is a highly time consuming and complicated
 procedure.
 In terms of supervised learning, the target labels acquisition is sometimes
 exceedingly expensive, e.g legal documents relevancy labeling

.
 The idea of the paper's methodology is to generalize the optimal learning
 and present its functionality regarding one of the most complex problems
 - coreference resolution.
 We simultaneously explore various correlated sectors such as i) active
 learning
\begin_inset Note Note

 Among a huge quantity of unlabeled data the machine is expected to tell
 to an annotator (subject matter expert or so called oracle) which labels
 from the set of unlabeled data will bring forth the most information about
 the studied problem.
 Hence, the learning involves less data annotations and the model is trained
 with less effort.
 The following task is formulated as a supervised learning technique trained
 with the data obtained by the sequential labels querying from a human expert.
 This branch of research involves integration of enhanced models uncertainty
 measurement algorithms e.g deep ensembles

 to the NLP problem for the empirical model weights distribution estimate.
 The additional information, given the distribution of predicted labels
 and the model prediction uncertainty
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

, allows for faster model learning (hot and warm start methods) with a lower
 number of training data.
 The architecture agnostic generalization of the empirical model weights
 distribution estimate will grant us more freedom in NLP models selection
 while preserving the precise insight into the model processes given prediction-
based uncertainty.
 The model uncertainty measurement and representation are done through the
 empirical estimate and sampling from the model weights distribution.
 The uncertainty representation approach provides the model with an expanded
 vision of both model learning and inference.
 The described technique has shown that such algorithms may enhance the
 learning process significantly

The subsequent branch of this paper is the active learning and model uncertainty
 integration into the coreference resolution problem.
 Coreference resolution (CR) combines detection and linking various mentions
 of entities within the text: linking noun phrases with their counterparts
 and pronouns, anaphora disambiguation, linking words with their pro-forms,
 etc..
 Hence, CR-solving models significantly impact the quality of the text mining
 algorithms.
 The state-of-art CR models' architectures
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 are not as massive as the language models and not as trivial as different
 NLP tasks.
 Thus, our inclination towards more complex neural network structures, tremendou
s requirements for context understanding, vast usage potential, and personal
 interest make this type of model the perfect candidate for uncertainty
 algorithms integration and improvement.
 A deeper insight into the models' decision making process given the uncertainty
 is expected to allow for a new coreference resolution state-of-art threshold
 to be set.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An exemplary use case where coreference resolution can be applied is categorizin
g entities and their pronouns to provide one with a broader spectrum of
 information for future decision making.
 Based on the extracted data, it is possible to unify all knowledge in the
 form of a Knowledge Graph (KG)
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 which can be further utilized for linking concepts represented by textual
 spans.
 Dependencies and connections between the entities can enrich the feature
 space with highly discriminative samples for other tasks.
 For example, assume that we have the following two consecutive sentences:
 "John Smith and Amanda Brown are accountants at XYZ company.
 Amanda’s colleague was accused of drunk driving".
 Based on these sentences, one would wish to classify if some of the entities
 from the text can be charged with a misdemeanor.
 For a human reader, it is evident that Amanda’s colleague refers to John.
 However, for a machine, that is a challenging task.
 Therefore, proper identification of entity clusters like John Smith, Amanda’s
 colleague, Amanda Brown, XYZ would significantly improve the machine’s
 understanding of the text.
 Another potential application of coreference resolution lies within the
 problem of opinion mining in media resources, where people frequently express
 their views and opinions.
 For example, heated discussions may emerge under political news articles.
 In these discussions, participants refer to subjects of the particular
 article with, for instance, pronouns.
 Therefore, proper CR may provide better traction of the audience’s attitude
 towards entities from the article by linking comment mentions to them.

Supervised classification of texts relies on the availability of reliable
 class labels for the training data.
 However, the process of collecting data labels can be complex and costly.
 A standard procedure is to add labels sequentially by querying an annotator
 until reaching satisfactory performance.
 Active learning is a process of selecting unlabeled data records for which
 the knowledge of the label would bring the highest discriminability of
 the dataset.
 In this part, we provide a comparative study of various active learning
 strategies for different embeddings of the text on various datasets.
 We focus on Bayesian active learning methods that are used due to their
 ability to represent the uncertainty of the classification procedure.
 We compare three types of uncertainty representation: i) SGLD, ii) Dropout,
 and iii) deep ensembles.
 The latter two methods in cold- and warm-start versions.
 The texts were embedded using Fast Text, LASER, and RoBERTa encoding techniques.
 The methods are tested on two types of datasets, text categorization (Kaggle
 News Category and Twitter Sentiment140 dataset) and fake news detection
 (Kaggle Fake News and Fake News Detection datasets).
 We show that the conventional dropout Monte Carlo approach provides good
 results for the majority of the tasks.
 The ensemble methods provide more accurate representation of uncertainty
 that allows to keep the pace of learning of a complicated problem for the
 growing number of requests, outperforming the dropout in the long run.
 However, for the majority of the datasets the active strategy using Dropout
 MC and Deep Ensembles achieved almost perfect performance even for a very
 low number of requests.
 The best results were obtained for the most recent embeddings RoBERTa

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The development of a text classifier on a new problem requires the availability
 of the training data and their labels.
 Labeling involves human annotators and a common practice is to label as
 many text documents as possible, train a classifier and search for new
 data and labels if the performance is unsatisfactory.
 Random choice of the documents for the data set extension can be costly
 because the new documents may not bring new information for the classification.
 Active learning strategy aims to select among available unlabeled documents
 those that the classifier is most uncertain about and queries an annotator
 for their labels.
 Therefore, it has the potential to greatly reduce the effort needed for
 the development of a new system.
 While it was introduced almost two decades ago, recent improvements in
 deep learning motivate our attempt to revisit the topic.
 For example, SVM-based active learning approaches for text classification
 date back to 2001 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, where the superiority of active learning over random sampling was demonstrated.
 Since deep recurrent and convolutional neural networks achieve better classific
ation results, Bayesian active learning methods for deep networks gained
 popularity especially in image classification

The Bayesian approach is concerned with querying labels for data for which
 the classifier predicts the greatest uncertainty.
 The uncertainty is quantified using the so-called acquisition function,
 such as predictive variance or predictive entropy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 While different acquisition functions often provide similar results, different
 representations of predictive distribution yield much more diverse results.
 The most popular approach using Dropout MC

 but require higher computational cost since they train an ensemble of networks
 after each extension of the data set.
 One potential solution of this problem has been recently proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

, where the ensemble is not trained from a fresh random initialization after
 each query but initialized randomly around the position of the ensembles
 from the previous iteration.
 In this contribution, we test this approach and compare it with the dropout
 MC and Langevin dynamics representations.
 We also provide sensitivity study for the choice of the hyperparameters.
 Active learning for fake news detection was considered in

 using uncertainty based on probability of classification.
 It was later extended to a context aware approach

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

and RoBERTa 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 RoBERTa is a modified BERT transformer model

 Transformer models provide state of the art results in context understanding

 with respect to different embedding techniques.
 Representation of the

 technique and 
\begin_inset Formula $𝑓_{\mathrm{sentence\ embed}}$
\end_inset

 is a function that creates sentence embeddings with respect to the given
 one-hot or byte pair encoded words.
 Fast Text encoding is made with respect to one-hot encoded words.
 LASER and transformer based models take byte-per encoded words as an input.
 Sentence embeddings for LASER and RoBERTa are output of deep neural network
 models.
 Sentence embedding for the Fast Text model is calculated as a mean value
 of all embeddings of words in the sentence.
 For supervised classification, each document embedding 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf x}_{i}$
\end_inset

 has to have an associated label 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We are concerned with binary classification for simplicity, however, an
 extension to multiclass is straightforward.
 We assume that for the full corpus of text documents 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}=[\mathbf{x}_{1},...,\mathbf{x}_{n}]$
\end_inset

, only an initial set of 
\begin_inset Formula $𝑙_{0}≪𝑛$
\end_inset

 labels is available, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}^{(0)}=[\mathbf{y}_{0},...,\mathbf{y}_{l_{9}}]$
\end_inset

, splitting the full set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 to the labeled, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{(0)}=[\mathbf{x}_{1},...,\text{x}_{𝑙_{0}}]$
\end_inset

, and unlabeled parts, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}\backslash\mathbf{X}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 Active learning is defined as a sequential extension of the training data
 set.
 In each iteration, 
\begin_inset Formula $𝑙=1,...,𝐿$
\end_inset

, the algorithm computes entropy of the predictive probability distribution
 for each document in the unlabeled dataset and selects the index of the
 document with the highest entropy (entropy acquisition function), formally:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
k_{l}=\argmax_{k\in K}\mathbb{E}_{p(\theta|\mathbf{X}^{(l-1)},\mathbf{Y}^{(l-1)})}\big(H(\mathbf{y}_{k}|\theta)\big)\label{eq:entropy_acquisition}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
H(\mathbf{y}_{k}|\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{y}_{k}|\theta,\mathbf{x}_{k})}(-\log p(\mathbf{y}_{k}|\theta,\mathbf{x}_{k})\label{eq:entropy_acsquisition_2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $𝐾$
\end_inset

 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $𝐻(\mathbf{y}_{𝑘}|𝜃)$
\end_inset

 is conditional entropy of the predicted class for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{𝑘}$
\end_inset

 The document of the selected index is sent to the human annotator with
 a request for labeling.
 When the selected text is annotated, the text is added with its label to
 the labeled data set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}^{(𝑙)}=[\mathbf{X}^{(𝑙−1)},\mathbf{x}_{𝑘_{𝑙}}]$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}^{(𝑙)}=[\mathbf{Y}^{(𝑙−1)},\mathbf{y}_{𝑘_{𝑙}}]$

 Due to the complexity of the neural networks it is always represented by
 samples, with a different method of their generation.
 We will compare the following methods: i) SGLD: Stochastic Gradient with
 Langevin dynamics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which adds additional noise to the gradient in stochastic gradient descent,

 all neurons where zeros is sampled through the network.

 While many of these have been tested in active learning, the majority of
 authors assumed that after each step of active learning, the network training
 starts from the initial conditions.
 This is clearly suboptimal, since the information from the previous training
 is lost.
 A simple solution was presented in

 be used as centroids around which the new initial point is sampled.
 Since this is a form of a warm-start, we also test warm-start strategies
 for Dropout.

 that trains only a single network with sampled dropout indices and uses
 the sampling even in the prediction step.
 Generation of the Monte Carlo prediction is obtained by sampling different
 values of the dropout binary variable and one forward pass of the network
 for each sample.
 We study three versions of the algorithm: i) cold-start with 3000 epochs
 after each request, ii) warm-start with weights from the previous iteration
 perturbed by an additive noise of variance 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 with 700 epochs and iii) hot-start, with 50 epochs after each request without
 perturbation (hot start is a warm-start method with 
\begin_inset Formula $q=0$

 Dropout rate is 0.5.

Specifically, we compared active learning and random sampling strategies
 for different settings of document embeddings and different representations
 of uncertainty.
 Each experiment was initiated by random choice of the initial training
 set of 
\begin_inset Formula $𝑙_{0}=10$
\end_inset

 samples from 1000 text documents (500 text documents per category), which
 were the initial 1000 documents of the datasets.
 For each experiment 
\begin_inset Formula $𝐿=200$
\end_inset

 requests for annotation are simulated.
 The document selection follows the 
\begin_inset Formula $𝜖-$
\end_inset

greedy approach

 is accepted with probability 
\begin_inset Formula $𝜖=\frac{\exp(𝑙−40)}{\exp(\text{𝑙−}40)+1}$
\end_inset

 .
 A random document is selected for labeling if not accepted.
 After each request, the classification performance is evaluated on the
 remaining part of the selected dataset (i.e.
 on the 990 text documents in the first evaluation) using the area under
 the ROC curve (AUC) metrics

The classification network was designed as a feed-forward NN with one dense
 layer of 100 neurons with sigmoid activation functions, and softmax output
 layer.
 Warm start versions of both Dropout MC and DEnFi have hyperparameter 𝑞
 that governs the perturbation of the previous result before training on
 the extended dataset.
 Tuning of this hyperparameter was performed by a grid search for both the
 Fast Text and RoBERTa text encoding techniques.
 Since the main focus of the paper is on the effect of the warm-start strategy,
 the results of the effect of the noise variance 
\begin_inset Formula $𝑞$
\end_inset

 for DEnFi and Dropout MC is displayed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and Table

 for active learning strategy on the Tech vs Science task and Fake News

Based on Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fast_text_roberta_tech_science"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 it is clearly seen that the variance of the perturbation noise related
 to the best result is increasing with the number of requests.
 We conjecture that the variance has the role of a selector of the exploration/e
xploitation tradeoff.
 Low variance favors exploitation and improves quickly, higher variance
 implies less accurate guesses in the initial iterations but better performance
 in the long run.
 The results from Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fast_text_roberta_tech_science"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 indicate that higher values of 
\begin_inset Formula $𝑞$
\end_inset

 are not performing well thus the range of 𝑞 was reduced for tuning of the
 hyperparameter for the fake news datasets.
 The increase of the optimum value of the noise variance with the number
 of requests is also visible in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fast_text_roberta_fake_news"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, especially for the RoBERTa encoded data.
 Since calibration of the variance for all methods and all datasets would
 be too computationally expensive, we ran all remaining experiments with
 
\begin_inset Formula $𝑞=0.3$
\end_inset

 for Fast Text encoding and 
\begin_inset Formula $𝑞=0.1$
\end_inset

 for RoBERTa and LASER encodings.
 However, tuning of this hyperparameter for an application scenario or an
 adaptive tuning strategy offers clearly a potential for further improvement.

 This experiment was designed for comparison of various uncertainty representati
ons.
 While all methods except for the Softmax Uncertainty achieved best results
 on some datasets, the most consistent results were delivered by the DEnFi
 and Dropout MC methods.
 The SGLD performance results exhibited the highest variance within the
 10 runs of the method.
 The results for three pair categories and an active learning strategy are
 visualized in figure 4.
 Since it is the least reliable method, we will not study it any further.
 It is clear from Table

 that the simple Softmax Uncertainty provides the worst results.
 Since Dropout MC has comparable computational complexity, the use of simple
 Softmax Uncertainty is always suboptimal.

 for Tweets and News Category datasets.
 For better insight, we also display the performance of the random sampling
 learning strategy where training data are extended using randomly sampled
 documents.
 Note that for random sampling, Dropout MC outperforms consistently DEnFi
 on all tasks.
 We conjecture that this is due to the robustness of the dropout regularization.
 However, the power of DEnFi becomes apparent with the increasing number
 of requests.
 It is improving slower than Dropout MC at the beginning, but improves faster,
 thus outperforming Dropout MC in the long run.
 We conjecture that this is due to better exploration capability of the
 DEnFi while Dropout MC excels at exploitation.
 The speed of improvement depends on the complexity of the learning task.
 For simpler tasks (such as crime vs.
 Good News), AUC over 0.98 is achieved quickly.
 However, for more complex tasks, such as Positive vs Negative Tweets, the
 number of data needed for improvement is much higher.
 The active learning is on par with the random sampling up to 125 requests
 and even after 200 requests, the AUC is below 0.7 indicating poor performance.
 Note that the active learning strategy of DEnFi starts improving over the
 random sampling sooner than Dropout MC with a sharper slope which indicates
 a high probability of obtaining the same profile as the other datasets
 in the long run.

 but for a wider choice of the document encoding techniques.
 Based on results from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 we show comparison of only the DEnFi and Dropout warm-start for three different

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The results for fake news datasets are similar to those for the Twitter
 and News Category datasets.
 Advantage of the DEnFi approach is significant only for the Fake News Detection
 dataset with Laser embeddings.
 For other cases the difference is negligible.
 Under the exploration/exploitation hypothesis, this means that the data
 sets are well separable and more sophisticated exploration capabilities
 of DEnFi are not needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best performance of the active learning strategy was achieved for the
 RoBERTa embedding.
 Note that the embedding has much greater influence on the speed of learning
 than uncertainty representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have studied the suitability of various uncertainty representations for
 the task of active text classification.
 The established Dropout MC methodology was compared against deep ensembles,
 SGLD and simple softmax strategy.
 To reduce the computational cost, we studied warm-start strategies for
 both ensembles (called DEnFi) and Dropout MC, that resulted in significant
 reduction of training epochs per the active learning iteration.
 The resulting methods exhibit a different tradeoff between exploration
 and exploitation.
 While Dropout MC has been found to be more reliable in random sampling
 strategy and improving faster at the beginning of active learning, the
 DEnFi was found to prefer exploration sacrificing performance at the beginning
 but outperforming Dropout MC in the longer run of active learning.
 The highest deviation of the random strategies between DEnFi and Dropout
 MC resulted in 0.04 AUC in favor of Dropout MC.
 However, for the active learning strategy both Dropout MC and DEnFi converged
 to the same numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sensitivity of the active learning to the choice of embedding was evaluated
 on the fake news datasets.
 It was observed that the most recent embedding method (RoBERTa) facilitated
 the fastest learning and that the choice of embedding was more important
 than the uncertainty representation.
 However, methods of active learning achieved significantly faster learning
 than the random sampling approach (the difference between the random and
 the active learning strategies differs from 0.015 AUC up to 0.080 AUC) on
 all tested datasets of various complexity.
